# Public Update set repository for use in ServiceNow
In this repository I public update sets with the configuration/code I use in my blogs and videos for easier access for the viewers & readers.

I take no responsibility on the results of using these update sets in your instances. Make sure that you always test them in a safe environment first. E.g. personal developer instance or your company dev instance.

As you can see below, I have splitted up each blog/video with some small description, link to video/blog as well as a download link for the update set. So just right-click and save ass and it will be downloaded.

To make it easier to download the update sets I made a link within each section

I go through how to use GlideAjax and the importance of setting both value and displayValue on a reference field.

Update set containing a Client script and a Script include. Example is used on incident form and when a CI is entered, it does a GlideAjax call, and returns a JSON with both the value and displayValue of the support group.
